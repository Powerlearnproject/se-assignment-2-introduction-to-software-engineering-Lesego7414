Create the architecture of the software. Design components, interfaces, and data flow. It acts as a blueprint for developers.
Implementation (Coding):

Write the actual code based on the design documents. This is where the software is built.
Testing:

Verify that the software works as intended. Identify and fix bugs. Ensure it meets the requirements and is of high quality.
Deployment:

Release the software to users. Install the software in the production environment and make it operational.
Maintenance:

Provide ongoing support and updates. Fix any issues that arise and add new features as needed. Ensure the software continues to meet user needs.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models
Agile Model:

Iterative Process: Develop software in small, incremental cycles called sprints.

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class/module should have one reason to change.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Entities should be open for extension but closed for modification.
Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not depend on unused interfaces.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not low-level modules.

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Testing in Software Engineering:

Modularity in Software Design
Division into Modules: Breaks down software into separate, self-contained units.
Functionality Focus: Each module performs a specific function or task.
